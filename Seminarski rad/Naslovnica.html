            <h2>What is nail art?</h2>
            <p>
                Nail art is a <b>creative way to paint, decorate, enhance, and embellish nails.</b> It is a type of artwork that <b>can be done on fingernails and toenails,</b> usually after manicures or pedicures. 
                Manicures and pedicures are beauty treatments that <u>trim, shape and polish the nails</u>. Often, these procedures <u>remove the cuticles and soften the skin around the nails. </u>
                Types of manicures can vary from polish on natural nails to dipping powder and acrylic nails.<br>

            <h2>History of nail art</h2>
            <p>
                In <b>1907, the first liquid nail polish</b> was invented, although it was colorless or transparent.
                Soon thereafter, it was available in variety of different colors. 
                In <b>1925, the lunar manicure (today known as the half-moon manicure) was seen everywhere. </b>
                Reds and pinks were used on the nail bed, while avoiding the area around the cuticles. 
                Then again in <b>1970s, the natural look was back in fashion</b> and preferred by many women, but only for a short time.
                The <em>manicure style was created in Paris in 1976 by Jeff Pink</em>, who was the founder of the Los Angeles-based cosmetic company ORLY.
                Nail painting came back in vogue in the 1980s and since then has been extremely popular.

            <h2>Nail art in culture and social media</h2>
            <p>
                In 2012, the United States witnessed the surging popularity of nail art. In the same year, a short nail-art documentary was released: "NAILgasm".
                The film explored the growing trend of nail art, from women across the world to high-fashion runways.
                Mostly women, but also men commonly use YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest to learn how to do the newest and most interesting designs at home.
                Interestingly, it was not a mainstream fashion trend before the 2000s.
                After the internet age and the common use of social media, the trend became a major subculture among women. 
                Social media made it easier to connect to the mass audience, and with this, people started to share their designs as a way of their creativity and use the nail as their blank canvas. 
                YouTube, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr, and Twitter are the major platforms, which provide many new ideas and designs for the subculture. 
                However, among these, <b>Pinterest</b> is the most important platform for new beauty trends according to a study.

            <h2>Techniques for building your nails</h2>
            <p>
                Manicurists start with the same techniques as for the manicure or pedicure:
                <ol type="I">
                    <li>
                        <b>Acrylics</b>: a chemical mixture of monomer liquid and polymer powder that can be directly applied on the nails or on artificial nails also called nails extensions or enhancements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Nail gel:</b> a chemical combination similar to acrylics, also known as shellac nails. Manicurist applies several layers on the fingernails or/and toenails and lets it cure under a UV or LED light. 
                        When the gel is cured it hardens the nails. Gel is also common in a polish form known as gel polish, and, like other forms of gel, also requires a UV or LED light to cure. 
                        The difference between acrylic and gel is that acrylic dries naturally but gel needs UV light to cure. Similarly, where regular nail polish will dry naturally, gel polish will remain tacky until cured by a UV light.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Nail polish/nail varnish:</b> a lacquer applied to finger and toe nails to protect or as a base color. 
                        Nail manicurists also use a base coat to protect and strengthen nails, as well as preventing the natural nail from yellowing or staining.
                    </li>
                </ol>
